The files in this directory are compiled to make the two OrbitTools libraries:
   orbitTools.core.lib
   orbitTools.orbit.lib

The "core" library contains contains several utility classes:

   cTle  – This class encapsulates a single set of NORAD two-line elements.
   cSite – Describes a location on the earth. Given the ECI coordinates of a 
           satellite, this class can generate Azimuth/Elevation look angles to 
           the satellite.
   cEci  – This class encapsulates Earth-Centered Inertial coordinates and 
           velocity for a given moment in time.
   cJulian - Encapsulates a Julian date/time system.

The "orbit" assembly contains the main SGP4/SDP4 implementation:

   cOrbit – Given a Tle object, this class provides information about the orbit
            of the described satellite, including inclination, perigee, 
            eccentricity, etc. Most importantly, it provides ECI coordinates and 
            velocity for the satellite.
   cNoradBase, cNoradSGP4, cNoradSDP4 – These classes implement the NORAD 
            SGP4/SDP4 algorithms. They are used by class cOrbit to calculate the
            ECI coordinates and velocity of its associated satellite.

All classes are contained within the Zeptomoby.OrbitTools namespace.

The project files were compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010.
